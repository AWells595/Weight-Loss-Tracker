# Weight Loss Tracker

## Requirements and Goals
This app was desigined for users to be able to sign in and enter daily weigh-in weigts which will be checked against there goal weight to determine if they achieved their goal or not. This is desinged to help faciliate weightloss by making the tracking of this information easy. 

## Screens and Features
This app has a log-in screen, a main dispaly screen that displays all the data in a grid, a screen to add or update existing data, and a screen to change the goal weight. I tried to make the UI simple and easy to understand an use as I think that provides the best overall exerpeince for the end users. My design was successful because of the simplciity of it.

## Design Approach
I approached designing this app entirely with the users in mind. I started by create the lay-out files so I knew what I'd be working with then added the functionality after. This allowed me to keep functionality in mind throughout the whole process rather than focusing on functionality then desiging a UI to take advatange of it. 

## Testing
To test my code I worked on each screen indivudally and ensured that it was working as intended. After it was working as intended I then connected all the disparte pieces together and ran through the entire use-case for the app and keep iterating on that until it felt good to use.

## Innovation
I had to innovate to get the data to display to the grid and to be able to pass the correct data to the edit data screen.

## Success
I think the grid layout is where I was best in demonstrating my skills as I both got to show off my skills of geting the data to the UI but also some Algorthimc knowledge by implenting a quick sort to sort the data descedning by date aka newest data first.
